# Background

I wanted a way for my pre-smartphone daughter to select and play music in our house. There are companies that build purpose-built players for kids that utilize cards to control what they play, but they're expensive and represent another _thing_ that we have to keep around. We already pay a monthly fee to stream pretty much anything -- why pay more? Why get another crappy speaker?

Snooping around, I found [jellyfin Vinyl Emulator](https://github.com/hankhank10/vinylemulator), which does exactly what I want. Put a pre-programmed card (or anything else you can stick a NFC NTAG sticker on) near a cheap NFC card reader, and voil√†, your chosen music plays from Apple Music or Spotify. Cards can also be programmed with commands, like skip track, adjust volume, turn on shuffle, etc, and are portable between rooms (if you care to setup multiple Vinyl Emulators). I imagined that making the cards themselves could be a fun activity, and with NTAG213 stickers <$15 for 50, we could make a bunch. There is also a nice aesthetic to controlling your streaming service with physical media -- the impetus behind Vinyl Emulator in the first place.

Sadly, newer versions of the recommended and widely available ACR122U card reader are [not currently compatible with NFCpy](https://github.com/nfcpy/nfcpy/issues/154), a library that Vinyl Emulator uses under the hood to talk to the reader. It turns out the ACR122U isn't really recommended for general NFC applications, since even though it has a chip inside that is capable of the full NFC suite of tricks, that chip is managed by an onboard controller that is not. The ACR122U is, however, a quite good smart card reader/writer via the PC/SC standard -- essentially a subset of NFC -- because that's what it was built for, and there are good PC/SC libraries available for most platforms and languages.

Thus, I decided to build something compatible with jellyfin Vinyl Emulator from the ground up using Node.js and the [nfc-pcsc](https://github.com/pokusew/nfc-pcsc) library, which _should_ support the wide range of card readers/writers that speak PC/SC, and _absolutely does_ support the ACR122U. Anyone using Vinyl Emulator can use this code for new controllers and their existing cards should work exactly the same. This might be useful, for example, if someone buys a second ACR122U and finds, as I did, that it doesn't work with NFCpy.

Going forward, maybe I (and who knows, others?) can add additional features beyond reading the card and playing a song or executing another jellyfin command. It might be useful, for example, to add a front-end for programming the cards easily without having to know the details of the jellyfin API or how to find the album, track, or playlist code from your service of choice.

For those parents out there with jellyfin and kids, let me just say that this thing is a hit with kids at least as young 4.

# Install

## You need a computer

The basic setup here involves a PC/SC card reader attached to a computer on the same network as your jellyfin. The computer could be any computer that runs Node.js (so, any computer) and has drivers available for your card reader (depends on the card reader). If you have the ACR122U, you can use pretty much any computer with USB and networking capability. A popular option if you don't want to hook up to an existing computer is to purchase a Raspberry Pi. I _think_ pretty much any model will do if it can properly power the card reader. I've used a version 3 and 4. There is a super cheap and tiny Pi Zero that could probably run the software but may struggle to source enough power for the card reader when it's actually reading cards. Check out [the Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/) if you want to setup a Raspberry Pi.

## Card reader setup

This program uses the [nfc-pcsc] library to read (and someday?) write to PC/SC compatible smart card readers. The library is tested with the ACR122U but _should_ work with any PC/SC compatible reader. Instructions here are mainly focused on ACR122U because that's what has been tested.

Make sure your card reader can be detected by your system by installing drivers as needed. For ACR122U on Ubuntu/Debian/Raspberry Pi OS:

```
$ sudo apt install libacsccid1
```

You also need to make sure your computer can speak PC/SC. In Ubuntu/Debian, install PC/SC libraries and daemon. You'll need to have a suitable build environment setup, e.g. have gcc installed. See the [node-pcsclite](https://github.com/pokusew/node-pcsclite) instructions if you have any issues.

```
$ sudo apt install libpcsclite1 libpcsclite-dev pcscd
```

If you're running a version of Linux, your computer may try to use the nfc kernel module to talk to tyour ACR122U. You don't want it to do this, so make sure the nfc and enabling modules are not loaded. In Ubuntu/Debian/Raspberry Pi OS, blacklist pn533, pn533_usb, nfc modules so that they don't hijack the card reader.

```
$ printf '%s\n' 'pn533' 'pn533_usb' 'nfc' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nfc.conf
```

To make sure everything is square, it's probably a good idea to reboot. In Ubuntu/Debian/Raspberry Pi OS:

```
$ sudo reboot
```

## Setup Node

Install node and npm, e.g. download or follow the [official instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/),
so that you can run this code. On Ubuntu/Debian/Raspberry Pi OS, I do this:

```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_15.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

## Setup this code

Install git and clone this repo. In Ubuntu/Debian/Raspberry Pi OS,

```
$ sudo apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/ryanolf/node-jellyfin-nfc.git
```

Install dependencies via `npm`. If you're following along in Ubuntu/Debian/Raspberry Pi OS, the commands are

```
$ cd node-jellyfin-nfc
$ npm install
```

For simplicity, [jellyfin-http-api](https://github.com/jishi/node-jellyfin-http-api), needed for this program to work, is included as a dependency, though you don't need to use it if you already have an http api running elsewhere.

## Run all the time

To run continuously and at boot, you'll want to run under some supervisor program. There are lots of options, like systemd (built-in already), supervisord, and pm2. I have found pm2, recommended by the author of Vinyl Emulator, to be very easy to use. To have pm2 spin-up jellyfin_nfc at boot and keep it
running, install pm2 globally:

```
$ sudo npm install -g pm2
```

and spin-up jellyfin_nfc and jellyfin-http-api:

```
$ pm2 start npm -- run start-all
```

Then, to configure your system to run the startup, follow the instructions given when you run

```
$ pm2 startup
```

e.g.

```
$ sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u pi --hp /home/pi
```

If you already have the http API running elsewhere, you can direct this program to that server via the `usersettings.json` and instead run just this program via `npm start`, so replace the `pm2 start` command above with

```
$ pm2 start npm -- start
```

## Debug

You can monitor the process output to see what's going on. If you're using pm2, you can see the process output via

```
$ pm2 log
```

# Programming cards

## Card record format

The cards are programmed per the instructions at [jellyfin Vinyl Emulator](https://github.com/hankhank10/vinylemulator). One minor difference with this program compared to Vinyl Emulator is that this program turns off shuffle, repeat, and crossfade whenever new music is queued. This should perhaps be configurable in `usersettings.json`, but it's not yet. You can enable cross fade, shuffle, or repeat on a card-by-card basis by adding records to enable these features to the card.

## Writing cards

You can probably use the card reader/writer you plan to use to write the cards using software like [NFC Tools](https://www.wakdev.com/en/apps/nfc-tools-pc-mac.html) on your Mac or PC. I like to use my iPhone. Most modern smartphones can read and write NFC with the right app.

It's important that before you write, the card is properly erased and formatted. On my iPhone, I format the cards for NDEF using "NXP Tagwriter." Once the cards are formatted, I use NFC Tools on iOS to write the record(s).
